## 2026-06-07 — Iron Series icons, equipment list, exercise library (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- Iron Series exercise library: all 40 `IRON_EXERCISES` now appear in Manage → Library → Exercises, searchable by name
- Added `Quads` and `Hamstrings` to `MUSCLE_FILTERS`; filter now checks `ex.primaryMuscle` in addition to `ex.muscle` so Iron exercises sort correctly into anatomical filter pills
- Added `equipment` arrays to all 30 `IRON_WORKOUTS` entries (sourced from original video descriptions): Dumbbells, Exercise Mat, Chair or Bench, Yoga Block, Glute Band as applicable per day
- IronSeriesView: equipment checklist renders below exercise list — emoji-tagged chips (🏋️ Dumbbells / 🟦 Mat / 🪑 Chair or Bench / 🧱 Yoga Block / 🔴 Glute Band) under a "YOU'LL NEED" header, divider above YouTube link
- Codex icon generation: Batches 1–3 complete and pushed (exercises 1–15: heel-elevated squat → bench dip); Batch 4 in progress (exercises 16–20)
- Iron Series tap-to-animate: ExerciseIcon components in IronSeriesView now pass `onDemoOpen` handler — tapping an icon opens ExerciseDemoModal

## 2026-06-07 — Apple Watch workout export pipeline (Codex)

- Added Supabase `apple_workouts`, `apple_workout_samples`, and `ecg_readings` tables; raw Health Auto Export payloads retained in `health_export_captures`
- Deployed `ingest-workouts` and `ingest-ecg` Edge Functions with `x-ironlog-ingest-key` validation; workout exports now parse into normalized summaries and minute samples
- Backfilled Phill's exported workout/ECG captures: 4 Apple Watch strength workouts, 477 samples, 1 ECG reading
- Added `ironlog_watch_matches` Supabase view linking Apple Watch workouts to IronLog sessions by time overlap and confidence
- IronLog Home now fetches Watch matches/workouts/ECG and shows a compact "Last workout matched" effort card; ECG remains stored but not used in normal readiness scoring

## 2026-06-07 — Polished Home screen redesign (Codex)

- Rebuilt the top Home screen toward the approved professional mockup: large readiness verdict card, action buttons, recommendation tiles, compact signal strip, recovery trend card, and combined weekly summary
- Added `dash` mini design system for Home cards, labels, chips, icon boxes, rounded surfaces, and softer shadows
- Added Home components: `ReadinessSummaryCard`, `TrainingRecommendationTiles`, `DailySignalsStrip`, `RecoveryTrendCard`, and `ThisWeekSummaryCard`
- Watch workout effort now informs the readiness explanation/reason chips instead of taking over the screen; ECG remains quiet unless needed later for abnormal recent readings
- Recovery trend chart height tightened so the first viewport shows more useful information before scrolling

## 2026-06-06 — Sleep-aware recovery score (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- `computeRecovery()` now adapts automatically based on sleep data availability
- **With sleep** (≥3 nights in 7-day window + last-night reading): HRV 40% + RHR 30% + Sleep 30% — matches Oura/WHOOP weighting
- **Without sleep** (watch not worn overnight): HRV 70% + RHR 30% — graceful fallback, clearly labelled as estimate
- Recovery card disclaimer updates dynamically: shows actual sleep hours and weights when sleep is available, or "no sleep reading for last night" when it isn't
- Extended `ingest-health` Edge Function (v2): added `sleep_analysis → sleep` to METRIC_MAP
- `pullHealthMetrics()` and `pushHealthMetrics()` now include sleep
- App state, startup `useEffect`, and localStorage load all extended for sleep
- Sleep metric: Health Auto Export reports "Sleep Analysis" as hours per night (no unit conversion needed)

## 2026-06-06 — Recovery score methodology overhaul (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- Replaced simple ratio formula with science-based SD-band approach (Buchheit 2014, Plews 2013, Altini/HRV4Training methodology)
- Baseline: 7-day rolling mean + standard deviation (was: 14-day mean ratio)
- Weighting: HRV 70%, resting HR 30% (was: 50/50 — HRV is more sensitive to recovery)
- Scoring: `score = clamp(50 + zCombined × 15, 0, 100)` where 50 = exactly at your average; each ±1 SD = ±15 pts
- Thresholds: Good ≥ 60, Fair 38–59, Low < 38 (was: Good ≥ 75, Fair ≥ 55)
- Real-data result for June 5/6: was 100% Good (inflated), now correctly 46% Fair (HRV 0.45σ below 7-day mean)
- Recovery ring now shows z-score context: "HRV ↑1.9σ · RHR ↓2.2"
- Added disclaimer: "Estimate · based on HRV + resting HR vs 7-day baseline · sleep data not yet available"
- Training recommendation thresholds updated to match new scale
- Requires ≥3 data points in 7-day window; fallback SD = 10% of mean (typical HRV CV)

## 2026-06-06 — Recovery Dashboard fixes and polish (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- Fixed StrengthWeekCard: was filtering out Iron Series sessions (`IRON_` exclusion). All completed sessions — A/B/C and Iron Series — now count toward weekly sessions, volume, and time
- Moved Cycling/Strength week cards + Weekly Heatmap + Recent Workouts above the Selected Workout hero card, so all health/activity data is grouped together at the top of the Home screen
- Metric cards: converted from 2×2 grid to horizontal 4-wide strip (all cards visible on screen without scrolling)
- MetricSparkline: converted from plain polyline to SVG area chart with gradient fill, matching target mockup's shaded sparkline style
- Added Lucide icons to each metric card (activity / heart / footprints / flame)
- Active Cal comparison now shows 7-day average value ("581 avg") instead of "+X vs avg" delta
- Today's Training cards: now use soft-blue icon box layout (Lucide dumbbell/bike) matching target mockup
- Weekly Activity Heatmap + Recent Workouts displayed side by side (heatmap ~45%, recent ~55%)
- Recovery ring capped at 100% visually — formula may exceed 100 but ring never overfills
- Trend chart x-axis: shows 3–4 evenly-spaced date labels instead of only first/last
- Strength week card stats in 3-column grid (Volume | Top Lift Increase | Total Time)
- Added Readiness sub-row to Recovery Summary card (label + context text)
- Today's Training shows regardless of whether health data is present

## 2026-06-06 — Recovery Dashboard — initial build (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- New Home screen greeting: "Good morning/afternoon/evening, Phill" with today's date
- Recovery Summary card: circular ring (green/amber/red, 0–100%), segmented fatigue bar, training load bar. Formula: `recoveryScore = round((hrvScore × 0.5) + (rhrScore × 0.5))` using 14-day rolling baseline
- Today's Training: two recommendation boxes (Weight Training, Cycling) with Recommended / Take it steady / Recovery suggested based on recovery score
- 4-metric sparkline grid: HRV, Resting HR, Steps, Active Cal — colour-coded vs 14-day rolling average
- Recovery Trends: dual-axis line chart (HRV blue, Resting HR red) with 7D / 30D / 90D toggle; data points green/amber/red vs baseline; auto-generated insight text
- Cycling This Week card: total km, % vs last week, longest ride, day-by-day bar chart
- Strength This Week card: sessions, volume (tonnes), top lift increase, total time, day-by-day bar chart
- Weekly Activity Heatmap: GitHub-style 5-week grid (Mon–Sun rows), colour-coded grey/blue-tint/blue/amber/green by steps+workout+goal status
- Recent Workouts section: last 3 activities (sessions + rides combined), "View all" → Log tab, "+ Log Workout" CTA
- New helpers: `computeRecovery()`, `computeFatigue()`, `computeTrainingLoad()`, `computeTrendInsight()`, `timeGreeting()`, `rollingAvg()`, `getLatestReading()`
- New components: `RecoveryRing`, `FatigueBar`, `MetricSparkline`, `RecoveryTrendChart`, `CyclingWeekCard`, `StrengthWeekCard`, `WeeklyHeatmap`, `RecentWorkoutsSection`
- All new sections hidden gracefully when no health data is present — existing workout flow unchanged
- Dashboard now accepts `healthData` prop; App passes it from state

## 2026-06-06 — Health tab chart improvements (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- X-axis date labels now show "May 30" / "Jun 5" instead of raw "05-30" / "06-05"
- Workout day markers (amber ▲ triangles) on chart x-axis for days with completed sessions
- HRV card: GOOD / FAIR / LOW recovery status badge + delta vs 30-day average
- Resting HR card: ↓/↑ week-over-week trend with "improving ✓" / "trending up" label
- Steps card: "X / N days hit target (XX%)" stat below chart
- Active Cal card: 7-day average callout below chart
- Import card demoted from prominent blue card to small text link at bottom of Body section
- "No data" copy updated to mention nightly auto-sync

## 2026-06-05 — Supabase health metrics pipeline (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

- Deployed `ingest-health` Supabase Edge Function — accepts Health Auto Export v1 JSON via POST, upserts to `health_metrics` table. Maps: `heart_rate_variability→hrv`, `resting_heart_rate→resting_hr`, `step_count→steps`, `active_energy→active_cal`. Converts active_energy kJ→kcal (÷4.184). Handles CORS.
- Created `health_metrics` Supabase table: columns `(metric text, date date, value numeric, updated_at timestamptz)`, PRIMARY KEY `(metric, date)`. RLS: anon SELECT, service-role INSERT/UPDATE.
- Added `pullHealthMetrics()`: fetches all health_metrics rows, sorts by metric type, returns `{hrv, restingHr, steps, activeCal}` arrays. Called on app startup in parallel with sessions/rides pulls.
- Added `pushHealthMetrics(healthData)`: upserts current health state to Supabase after bulk import. Fire-and-forget cloud backup.
- Added `localDateStr()` helper: formats Date objects as YYYY-MM-DD in local timezone (fixes UTC mismatch bugs where early-morning workouts appeared on previous day)
- Fixed consistency heatmap streak counter to start from today (not array end) — future cells no longer zero out streaks
- Startup `useEffect` parallelised: `Promise.all([pullSessions, pullRides, pullHealthMetrics])`. Cloud health data takes precedence over localStorage cache.
- Added `parseHealthAutoExport()`: parses Health Auto Export v1 JSON, extracts HRV/Resting HR/Steps/Active Cal, converts units, validates dates, returns merged readings
- Health tab Body section: "Import Health Auto Export JSON" bulk import modal (accepts full export file, merges all metrics at once, syncs to cloud on confirm)
- Health Auto Export automation configured: POST to Edge Function URL, 1-Day sync cadence, nightly auto-export

## 2026-06-05 — Shortcuts Health Import Compatibility

- Health Body import now accepts Shortcuts-friendly `{"dates":"...","values":"..."}` JSON and zips newline-separated rows into readings
- Existing `[{date,value}]` health import format still works
- Removed Sleep from the Body metrics; retained HRV, Resting HR, Steps, Active Calories, and Cardio Fitness

## 2026-06-05 — Apple Health Body Import

- Added Health → Body section for Apple Watch / Apple Health imports
- Added localStorage-backed imports for HRV, Resting HR, Steps, Active Calories, Cardio Fitness, and Sleep
- Added paste-JSON import modal per metric with validation, date dedupe, newest-value merge, imported count, and error feedback
- Added Body charts: HRV and Resting HR 30-day lines, Steps / Active Calories / Sleep 14-day bars, and sparse Cardio Fitness line chart
- Added HRV workout-day vs rest-day comparison for the last 30 days when enough HRV data exists

## 2026-06-05 — Health Tab (Training section)

- Added ❤️ Health tab (7th nav tab)
- Weekly volume: 6-week bar chart (kg × reps, completed kg sets, non-Iron sessions)
- Volume by workout type: Push / Pull / Legs+Core horizontal bars for current week
- Consistency: 28-day heatmap grid + streak / total sessions / per-week stats
- Recent PRs: kg exercises that hit their all-time max weight within the last 30 days
- Effort trend: line chart of average RPE per session, last 10 sessions, coloured green/amber/red by intensity
- Body section (Apple Watch / HRV / Sleep) deferred — to be added once Watch Shortcut is set up

## 2026-05-30 — Iron Series Integration

- Added Caroline Girvan's Iron Series (30 workouts, 6-week dumbbell programme) as a parallel programme
- Workout tab now has "My Split / 🔩 Iron Series" toggle — both programmes track independently
- 40 new exercises in `IRON_EXERCISES` constant; 30 workouts in `IRON_WORKOUTS` constant
- `nextIronDay(sessions)` derives next Iron day from session history; loops back to Day 1 after Day 30
- Iron sessions: energy check → exercises → complete (no warmup, no finisher; user follows video)
- `defaultDuration` is reference-only — no timer lockout; user follows video timing
- History: Iron sessions show `🔩 N` day badge and "Iron Series — Day N" title
- Exercises shared with A/B/C (RDL, hip thrust, etc.) contribute to the same Stats charts
- 40 MUSCLE_META entries added for all new Iron exercises
- Direct YouTube video IDs populated for all 30 Iron days; icons remain a separate Codex pass — see ICON-GUIDE.md

## 2026-05-28 — Per-Workout Warm-Up Defaults

- `WARMUP_GROUPS.defaultId` changed from a single string to `{ A, B, C }` so each workout gets targeted defaults
- Workout A (Push): Chest slot = chest-opener; Hips = figure-four; Ankles = circles
- Workout B (Pull): Chest slot = biceps-wall stretch (primes pull chain); Hips = hip-flexor; Ankles = circles
- Workout C (Legs): Chest slot = upward-dog (thoracic/hip-flexor); Lower Back = child's pose (lumbar decompression); Hips = 90/90-hip; Ankles = dorsiflexion
- Neck, shoulders, trunk, and legs (hamstring) unchanged across all workouts — sciatica/hamstring care retained
- `getWarmupConfig` and `saveWarmupChoice` updated to resolve per-workout defaults; existing saved choices unaffected

---

## 2026-05-26 — Session Set Editing

- History: expanded session cards now have an "✏ Edit" button (left) alongside "🗑 Delete" (right)
- Edit mode: inline input rows for weight, reps, RPE, pain, duration per set
- Add set (copies last set's values) and delete set per exercise
- Exercise notes editable as a text field
- Save writes to localStorage immediately; Cancel discards all changes
- Handles all exercise types: standard (kg), timed (secs), bodyweight, band, pullup-tracking (bw/band/neg)

---

## 2026-05-26 — Customisable Stretch Routine

- Added `STRETCH_GROUPS` constant: 12 body-part slots each with a default stretch and picker options
- Added `getStretchConfig()`, `saveStretchChoice()`, `resetStretchConfig()` helpers; storage key `il_stretch_config`
- Added `StretchSetup` component: 12 rows with Change button, duration estimate, Reset to defaults
- Added `StretchPicker` component: full-screen overlay with all options for a slot; Sciatica/Cross-legged/Caution pills
- Added `StretchActive` component: guided execution with SVG countdown ring, bilateral auto-advance (1.5s Switch Sides), three footer states, Skip all
- Dashboard: replaced static stretch accordion with simple card + "Start Stretching" button
- Removed old `ActiveStretch` component
- `view === 'stretch'` aliased to `'stretch_setup'` for backward compatibility

---

## 2026-05-25 — Warm-Up UX refinements + Stats picker grouping

- Warm-up execution: timer now requires a manual **▶ Start** tap before counting down — gives time to read the stretch and get into position
- Bilateral stretches (e.g. Neck Rotation): side 1 requires manual start; when it finishes a green ✓ Switch Sides indicator shows for 1.5s then side 2 auto-starts — no second tap needed
- Fixed warm-up active screen footer being hidden behind the fixed nav bar (missing `paddingBottom` to clear safe-area + nav height)
- Stats screen exercise picker now grouped by workout (Workout A — Push / Workout B — Pull / Workout C — Legs + Core / Other) with exercises sorted A–Z within each group, using native `<optgroup>` labels

## 2026-05-24 — Customisable Warm-Up

- Replaced static warm-up checklist with a three-screen flow: **Setup → Picker → Guided execution**
- Setup screen: 8 compact rows (one per muscle-tendon group — Neck, Shoulders, Chest, Trunk, Lower Back, Hips, Legs, Ankles), each with a Change button
- Picker: full-screen overlay per group showing curated stretch options with Sciatica / Cross-legged / Caution pills so you can pick based on your goal
- Guided execution: one stretch at a time, SVG countdown ring, cue text; see 2026-05-25 entry for final execution behaviour
- Per-workout config (A, B, C each store independent choices) persisted in `il_warmup_config` localStorage key
- Skip Warm-Up and Reset to defaults available from the setup screen; Skip all → and Skip this stretch available during execution
- Backward compatible: sessions stored with old `phase:'warmup'` resume at the setup screen

## 2026-05-24 — 8 new stretches + three-way filter (Sciatica / Cross-legged)

- **Sciatica additions** (from OAH clinical PDF + Healthline): Knee to Opposite Shoulder, Double Knee to Chest, Supine Sciatic Nerve Glide, Lower Trunk Rotations (Wig Wags ⚠️ disc caution). SCIATICA_IDS now covers 15 stretches.
- **Cross-legged sitting additions**: Butterfly Stretch (adductors — the key missing piece), Deep Squat Hold (⚠️ disc caution), Lateral Lunge Stretch, Pilates Saw (posture/thoracic). CROSS_LEGGED_IDS covers 14 stretches.
- Stretches tab filter upgraded from 2-way to 3-way: **All / ◈ Sciatica / ⊕ Cross-legged**. Purple pill = Sciatica, Green pill = Cross-legged. Both flags independent (a stretch can carry both).
- Total stretch library: 39 cards.

## 2026-05-24 — Sciatica Stretches + Filter

- Added 2 new sciatica-specific stretches: Sciatic Nerve Floss (neural mobilisation), Seated Piriformis Stretch. Both appear in the Stretches tab.
- 11 stretches now flagged `sciatica: true` via `STRETCH_SCIATICA_IDS` set — includes Figure Four, Pigeon, Child's Pose, Knee to Chest, both hamstring stretches, Prone Cobra, 90/90 Hip, Seated Forward Fold, and both new ones.
- Purple "Sciatica" pill shown on flagged cards. "All stretches / ◈ Sciatica only" toggle added to the Stretches tab header.

## 2026-05-24 — Stretch Library Expanded (13 new stretches)

- Added 13 new stretches to STRETCH_LIBRARY covering all 8 major muscle-tendon groups: neck (Neck Rotation), shoulders (Overhead Triceps Stretch), chest (Upward Facing Dog, Biceps Wall Stretch), trunk (Standing Side Bend), lower back (Knee to Chest, Lying Spine Twist ⚠️), hips (90/90 Hip Stretch, Pigeon Pose ⚠️), legs (Standing Quad Stretch, Seated Forward Fold), ankles (Ankle Circles, Wall Ankle Dorsiflexion). Caution banners added for Lying Spine Twist and Pigeon Pose. Redrawn icons for str_pec_roller_t, str_pec_roller_w, str_it_band committed. Library now shows 29 stretch cards total.

## 2026-05-23 — Stretch Library Tab

- Manage → Library now has Exercises / Stretches sub-tabs. Stretches tab shows 19 curated items (12 full-body flexibility, 5 warm-up mobility, 2 workout finishers) with expandable cards: stretch image, MuscleDiagram with target-area highlights, hold time, and cue text.

## 2026-05-20 — Exercise View Improvements

- Previous session notes reminder: if notes were written for an exercise in the last session, shown as a read-only 📝 banner above the set rows
- Muscle diagram collapsed by default: tap MUSCLES ▼ to expand, resets to collapsed on each exercise

## 2026-05-19 — AI Coach & Home Screen Redesign

- Added `computeCoachRecommendation(sessions, rides, override)` rules engine
- Reads last 7 days: pain ≥ 3, avg RPE ≥ 8, ride within 48h, days since last session ≥ 4
- New `'preStart'` view — review modifications and optionally swap exercises before session begins
