## Fixed

### BUG-002 [FIXED] Overload nudge fires too early
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 (confirmed by Claude code review — fix already in codebase)
**Detail:** Several exercises have `defaultReps === repMax` (goblet squat, DB bench, KB deadlift, split squat). Completing prescribed reps on the first session triggers "add load." Logic also ignored high pain and high RPE.
**Fix applied:** `checkOverloadNudges` guards with `def.repMax <= def.defaultReps` (early return), `doneSets.some(s => Number(s.pain) >= 3)` (pain gate), and avgRpe > 8 check excluding blank RPE values. Per-set comparison remains `>= repMax`.

### BUG-003 [FIXED] Import validation missing — bad JSON shape crashes app
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 (confirmed by Claude code review — fix already in codebase)
**Detail:** `importData()` parses JSON but does not validate that `sessions` and `rides` are arrays. Also does not call `setActiveSession(null)` on success — importing mid-workout leaves a stale active session in state.
**Fix applied:** `handleImport` validates `sessions`, `rides`, and `customExercises` with `Array.isArray()` checks and throws descriptive errors on mismatch. `setActiveSession(null)` called on successful import.

### BUG-004 [FIXED] Resume state incomplete — phase, exIdx, and elapsed time reset on reload
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 (confirmed by Claude code review — fix already in codebase)
**Detail:** When `il_active` exists, `ActiveWorkout` always reopened at workout phase and exercise index 0. Elapsed time restarted from zero.
**Fix applied:** Phase restores from `activeSession?.phase`. `exIdx` initialises via `findIndex` to first exercise with any incomplete set. Elapsed computed as `Math.floor((Date.now() - session.startTime) / 1000)` using wall-clock timestamp; timer interval also anchors to `session.startTime`.

### BUG-005 [FIXED] Blank Train screen — no recovery path for malformed active session
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 (confirmed by Claude code review — fix already in codebase)
**Detail:** If `il_active` contains a session with no valid `exercises` array, the workout phase returned `null` with no recovery path.
**Fix applied:** Guard at top of `ActiveWorkout` render: if `session` exists but `session.exercises` is not a non-empty array, renders a "SESSION DATA CORRUPTED" screen with a "Clear Session & Start Fresh" button that calls `setActiveSession(null)`.

---

### BUG-008 [FIXED] Finisher notes lost on reload before completion
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 by Claude
**Detail:** Finisher note updates only local `session` state and never called `setActiveSession`. Notes typed before tapping Complete were lost on reload.
**Fix applied:** `onChange` now calls both `setSession` and `setActiveSession` so notes are immediately persisted to localStorage.

---

### BUG-009 [FIXED] EXERCISES not browseable in Manage → Library
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 (confirmed by Claude code review — fix already in codebase)
**Detail:** The Library tab in Manage only showed `PRESET_LIBRARY` and custom exercises. Base `EXERCISES` items were not listed.
**Fix applied:** `libraryEntries` in `Manage` now spreads `Object.entries(EXERCISES)` first, followed by `PRESET_LIBRARY` and `customExercises`.

---

### BUG-010 [FIXED] Equipment-incompatible exercises appear in mid-session Add Exercise picker
**Fixed:** 2026-05-18 by Claude
**Detail:** Cable machines, leg press, T-bar row, and other equipment the user does not own appeared in the Add Exercise picker mid-session.
**Fix applied:** Added `gymOnly: true` to 7 machine-only exercises (p_cable_fly, p_lat_pulldown, p_seated_cable_row, p_t_bar_row, p_leg_press, p_leg_extension, p_seated_leg_curl). The picker now filters out any exercise where `gymOnly === true`.

---

### BUG-001 [FIXED] False PR detection on undone sets
**Fixed:** 2026-05-13 by Claude
**Commit:** f0ba663
**Detail:** `detectPRs` included sets where `s.done === false`. Pre-filled weights from the previous session that were never lifted could register as PRs. Also affected historical baseline (`prevMax`).
**Fix applied:** `filter(s => s.done)` added before mapping weights in both current-session and historical-session paths.

---

### BUG-006 [FIXED] Contraindicated exercises in PRESET_LIBRARY
**Fixed:** 2026-05-13 by Claude
**Commit:** 908a90d
**Detail:** `p_good_morning` (loaded spinal flexion), `p_russian_twist` (loaded spinal rotation), and `p_nordic_curl` (extreme eccentric hamstring load) were present in PRESET_LIBRARY and appeared in the mid-session Add Exercise picker. All three are contraindicated for this user's medical constraints.
**Fix applied:** All three removed from PRESET_LIBRARY.

---

### BUG-007 [FIXED] p_pull_up cue unsafe for shoulder bursitis
**Fixed:** 2026-05-13 by Claude
**Commit:** 908a90d
**Detail:** Cue said "full hang to chin over bar" without specifying grip width. Wide-grip pull-ups are contraindicated for bilateral shoulder bursitis.
**Fix applied:** Cue updated to specify shoulder-width or narrower grip only, band-assisted start, negatives progression.
