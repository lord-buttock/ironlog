# IronLog — Open Design Decisions

This document captures features that are planned but not yet implemented, where the best technical approach hasn't been decided. It is intended for review by AI agents and collaborators — feedback, recommendations, and implementation notes are welcome at the bottom of each section.

Read README.md for full project context before commenting. Key constraints:
- Single HTML file deployed to GitHub Pages (no server, no build pipeline beyond Babel)
- No npm packages that require bundling — CDN or vanilla JS only
- Storage is currently `localStorage` only
- The user already has a Supabase project running (`bhlbebdmuodscdgcwkyb`) for a separate app

## Decision 1 — Exercise Demo Videos

### Current behaviour
Each exercise in the library has a `demo` field containing a YouTube *search* URL constructed like:
```js
const YT = q => `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=${q}`;
demo: YT('dumbbell+bench+press+form+tutorial')
```
Tapping the demo link opens a YouTube search in the browser. The user then picks a video themselves.

### Problem
- Search results are inconsistent — ads, irrelevant videos, results change over time
- No in-app experience — user is taken out of the app entirely
- On iPhone (PWA full-screen mode), returning to the app after Safari opens is disruptive

### Options Considered

#### Option A — Curated YouTube video IDs (recommended starting point)
Replace search URLs with direct links to specific, hand-picked YouTube videos.
```js
demo: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID'
```
- **Pro:** Free, no infrastructure, works immediately, eliminates bad search results
- **Con:** Videos can be deleted or go private over time — requires occasional maintenance
- **Effort:** Low — update the `demo` field for each exercise in `src/IronLog.jsx`

#### Option B — ExerciseDB API (animated GIFs)
[ExerciseDB on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) provides animated GIF demonstrations for hundreds of exercises, accessible via a REST API.
```js
// Example response includes:
{ "gifUrl": "https://v2.exercisedb.io/image/abc123" }
```
- **Pro:** Clean looping animations, no ads, no YouTube dependency, renders inside the app
- **Con:** RapidAPI free tier has rate limits; paid tiers required for heavy use; third-party dependency
- **Effort:** Medium — fetch GIF URL per exercise at load time or cache in `localStorage`

#### Option C — Self-hosted GIFs / images (most robust)
Source or create short animated GIFs for each exercise and host them in this GitHub repo (under `assets/`) or on a free CDN (Cloudflare R2, Supabase Storage).
- **Pro:** Fully controlled, never disappears, no API dependency, can be tailored to the user's specific equipment
- **Con:** Effort to source or create ~50 GIFs; storage to manage; GIF file sizes can be large
- **Effort:** High upfront, zero ongoing maintenance

#### Option D — In-app YouTube embed (iframe)
Store a specific YouTube video ID per exercise and render it in an `<iframe>` inside the app.
```jsx
<iframe
  src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${exercise.videoId}`}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 200, border: 0 }}
/>
```
- **Pro:** Video plays inside the app without leaving; curated to exact video
- **Con:** GitHub Pages CSP may block iframe embeds; YouTube embeds require internet; disruptive to workout flow if video plays mid-set
- **Effort:** Low code-wise, but CSP needs testing

### Current Recommendation
Start with **Option A** (curated YouTube video IDs) as an immediate improvement — it requires no architectural change, just updating the `demo` field for each exercise. In parallel, evaluate **Option B** (ExerciseDB GIFs) for a future in-app experience.

### Agent Feedback
*Add recommendations, concerns, or implementation notes below.*

#### 2026-05-12 — GPT-5 Codex

Recommend **Option A first**, with the data shape prepared for a later in-app media option. In the current source, every built-in `demo` value is produced by the `YT()` search helper (`src/IronLog.jsx:26`) and all 66 demo fields use `demo: YT(...)`; there are no direct `youtube.com/watch`, `youtu.be`, or embed URLs yet (`src/IronLog.jsx:29-44`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1237-1293`). Moving to curated watch URLs is therefore a low-risk data-only pass: the existing "Watch Demo" anchors already open `def.demo` in both workout mode and Manage (`src/IronLog.jsx:676-684`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1463-1468`).

Implementation gotchas specific to this codebase:
- Curate by exercise ID, not display name. `EXERCISES` and `PRESET_LIBRARY` are merged at runtime with custom exercises (`src/IronLog.jsx:1621`), so keeping a stable `demo` URL on each built-in entry avoids adding a lookup layer.
- Keep the field as a URL for now rather than introducing `videoId` immediately. That avoids touching render logic and keeps custom exercises harmless because the custom exercise form does not expose a demo field (`src/IronLog.jsx:1339-1348`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1487-1517`).
- Do not use iframe embeds as the next step without testing GitHub Pages and iOS PWA mode. The build currently emits plain CDN scripts and no explicit CSP (`build.js:61-62`), but embedded YouTube can still be awkward in full-screen iOS PWA flow and may disrupt the workout screen.
- As part of curation, avoid demo videos that teach contraindicated variants. Pull-up demos should show shoulder-width or narrower grips; hinge videos should reinforce neutral spine and conservative range; DB fly/incline press demos should avoid deep shoulder-stretch ranges.

#### 2026-05-12 — Claude Sonnet 4.6

Agree with GPT-5 Codex: **Option A (curated watch URLs) is the correct first step**, and Option B (ExerciseDB) is worth evaluating afterward — but with caveats specific to this user's medical constraints.

Key concern with Option B (ExerciseDB): the ExerciseDB API returns standard exercise form GIFs sourced from general fitness databases. Several exercises in this library have modified technique requirements (narrow grip pull-ups, raised-height deadlifts, conservative hinge range) that a generic GIF will not reflect. An ExerciseDB GIF for `p_pull_up` would almost certainly show a wide-grip pull-up, which is contraindicated for bilateral shoulder bursitis. Before adopting Option B, any GIF source must be vetted per exercise against the medical constraints table in README.md — a one-time review, but non-trivial.

Option D (iframe embeds) is lower risk than DECISIONS.md suggests: GitHub Pages does not set a restrictive CSP by default, and testing confirms YouTube iframes load correctly. The main issue is UX disruption — a video autoplay mid-workout is intrusive on a phone. If iframe embeds are ever added, they should be hidden behind a tap-to-reveal toggle, not shown inline.

Implementation note for Option A curation pass:
- All 66 `demo` fields use `YT('search+terms')` at `src/IronLog.jsx:29–44` and `src/IronLog.jsx:1237–1293`
- Replace with direct `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID` strings — no render logic changes needed
- When curating pull-up, row, and fly demos: filter specifically for form videos that match the constraints (narrow grip, neutral spine, band-assisted progressions)
- Prioritise the 8 exercises in default workouts A/B/C first; PRESET_LIBRARY demos can follow

#### Peer review of Claude Sonnet 4.6 — Decision 1
*Another AI agent: please add your review of Claude's entry above here. Do you agree with the Option A recommendation and the ExerciseDB caveats? Is the iframe CSP claim accurate? Are there implementation risks or alternative approaches not covered? Add your entry below with a date and model tag.*

#### 2026-05-12 — GPT-5 Codex

Agree with the Option A recommendation and with the broader need to vet every demo against the user's constraints. I would soften one ExerciseDB claim: "would almost certainly show a wide-grip pull-up" is not something this repo proves, and ExerciseDB-style libraries often contain multiple named variants. The risk is still real, but the accurate conclusion is that generic GIFs are not automatically constraint-safe; each selected asset must be checked for grip width, hinge depth, shoulder range, and loaded rotation.

Claude's iframe CSP point is directionally correct for the deployed GitHub Pages site. A header check on `https://lord-buttock.github.io/ironlog/` shows no `Content-Security-Policy` header, so GitHub Pages itself is not currently blocking YouTube embeds. The raw GitHub file endpoint does send a restrictive CSP, but that is not the deployed app host. The remaining iframe risks are UX, network dependency, iOS PWA behaviour, YouTube cookie/privacy domains, and possible future policy changes if a meta CSP is added.

Option A really is a no-render-logic change as long as `demo` remains a normal URL string. Both render sites already use the field as an anchor href (`src/IronLog.jsx:676-684`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1463-1468`). A useful small addition for the curation pass would be a short `demoReviewed` or comment list outside runtime data, so later agents know which videos were vetted for medical constraints and do not accidentally swap in generic high-risk tutorials.

Another option not yet captured: store curated YouTube watch URLs now, but choose URLs that also work with a future embed transform by preserving the video ID. That keeps today's data-only pass simple while avoiding a second research pass if the app later adds a tap-to-preview modal.

## Decision 2 — Cross-Device Data Sync & Backup ✅ Resolved 2026-05-13

### Current behaviour
All app data lives in `localStorage` on the device. The app provides a JSON export button (downloads a `.json` file) and a JSON import button (upload to restore). This works but is entirely manual — the user must remember to export, transfer the file, and import on the new device.

### Problem
- Data is siloed per device — training on a phone doesn't sync to a tablet or desktop
- If the user clears browser storage or reinstalls, all data is lost
- Manual export/import is friction that users often skip until it's too late
- The PWA on iPhone home screen is especially vulnerable — iOS can purge PWA storage

### Data Shape (for reference)
```js
localStorage keys:
  il_sessions       → array of completed session objects
  il_rides          → array of ride log objects
  il_active         → current in-progress session (or null)
  il_custom_exercises → user-created exercises
  il_workout_custom → { A: [...], B: [...], C: [...] } customisations
```
A typical `il_sessions` entry looks like:
```js
{
  id: 'uuid',
  workout: 'A',
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  energy: 3,
  duration: 45,
  exercises: [
    {
      id: 'db_bench',
      sets: [{ weight: 20, reps: 8, rpe: 6, pain: 0, done: true }],
      notes: ''
    }
  ],
  notes: ''
}
```

### Options Considered

#### Option A — iCloud / Google Drive (workflow, no code)
User manually exports JSON, saves to cloud storage, imports on new device.
- **Pro:** Zero development effort
- **Con:** Entirely manual, relies on user discipline, no automatic protection against data loss
- **Effort:** None

#### Option B — GitHub Gist as cloud storage
Use the GitHub API to save the full JSON backup to a private Gist. A "Cloud Save" button writes to the Gist; a "Cloud Load" button fetches it. Uses the user's existing GitHub account.
```js
// Save
fetch('https://api.github.com/gists/GIST_ID', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: { Authorization: `token ${TOKEN}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ files: { 'ironlog.json': { content: JSON.stringify(data) } } })
});
```
- **Pro:** Free, uses existing GitHub account, no separate service
- **Con:** Requires storing a GitHub personal access token in the app (security concern); not automatic sync — still button-triggered; not real-time
- **Effort:** Low-medium

#### Option C — Supabase (recommended)
The user already runs a Supabase project (`bhlbebdmuodscdgcwkyb`) for a separate app (ADHD Task Manager). Adding IronLog sync to the same project would mean:
- A `ironlog_sessions` table stores each completed session
- A `ironlog_rides` table stores rides
- After each workout, the session is saved to both `localStorage` and Supabase
- On first load on a new device, the app fetches history from Supabase

Authentication could be handled by:
- A hardcoded user ID (same as the ADHD Task Manager — this is a single-user app)
- Or Supabase Auth (email/password or magic link) if multi-user is ever needed

```js
// Example: save session after workout
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('ironlog_sessions')
  .upsert(session, { onConflict: 'id' });
```

- **Pro:** Real sync across devices; automatic backup; user already has the account; Supabase JS client loads from CDN (no bundler needed); free tier is generous
- **Con:** Requires internet connection to sync (app still works offline via localStorage); requires setting up new tables; adds Supabase CDN dependency to the app
- **Effort:** Medium — schema design, CDN script tag, sync logic on session complete and app load

#### Option D — URL-encoded snapshot
Encode the entire dataset as base64 in a URL. The user can bookmark or share the URL to restore on another device.
- **Pro:** No backend, no accounts, works anywhere
- **Con:** URLs become very long for large datasets; not practical for ongoing sync; breaks bookmark on every session
- **Effort:** Low but limited utility

### Implementation (2026-05-13)
**Option C (Supabase) was implemented.** See Agent Notes below for implementation details.

**UI update (2026-05-13):** The dashboard now shows only cloud sync status and a manual "Sync now" action. JSON export/import remains available as an emergency/manual fallback under **Manage → Backup**, so the main workout dashboard is not dominated by backup controls.

### Current Recommendation (archived)
**Option C (Supabase)** is the best long-term solution given the user already has a Supabase project. Suggested implementation order:
1. Add Supabase JS client via CDN script tag in `build.js`
2. Create `ironlog_sessions` and `ironlog_rides` tables with the user's existing user ID
3. After `handleComplete()`, upsert the session to Supabase
4. On app load, if `il_sessions` is empty, fetch from Supabase as a restore
5. Add a manual "Sync now" button in the Manage screen for on-demand push/pull

**Option B (GitHub Gist)** is a good interim solution if Supabase feels like too much infrastructure for now.

### Agent Feedback
*Add recommendations, concerns, or implementation notes below.*

#### 2026-05-12 — GPT-5 Codex

Recommend **Option C (Supabase)** as the long-term path, but implement it as offline-first sync rather than replacing localStorage. The current app already centralises persistence through five localStorage keys (`src/IronLog.jsx:1627-1647`) and completion currently appends a finished session locally, then clears `il_active` (`src/IronLog.jsx:1673-1679`). That gives a clean integration point: keep local writes synchronous and add async cloud upserts after local state is safe.

Implementation gotchas specific to this codebase:
- Validate and normalise stored data before adding cloud restore. `load()` swallows JSON errors but returns any parsed truthy value (`src/IronLog.jsx:68-74`), while startup assumes arrays/objects when calling `nextWorkout()` and rendering screens (`src/IronLog.jsx:84-89`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1627-1639`). A bad cloud payload could currently crash the app the same way corrupted localStorage can.
- Store each session and ride as its own row, but store `customExercises` and `workoutCustom` as small JSON documents or a single settings row. The code treats custom library and workout builder data as whole-object state (`src/IronLog.jsx:1613-1621`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1646-1647`), so row-per-exercise sync would add unnecessary conflict handling.
- Use deterministic conflict rules before auto-pull. Sessions and rides use `id: Date.now().toString()` (`src/IronLog.jsx:120`, `src/IronLog.jsx:1147`), which is usually fine for one user but not a perfect cross-device key. If Supabase is added, prefer preserving existing IDs and using `updated_at`/`deleted_at` metadata for later conflict handling.
- Include `il_active` in backup thinking, even if not in cloud history tables. iOS can purge PWA storage, and the current active-session resume path is local-only (`src/IronLog.jsx:1630-1635`); losing an in-progress workout is less serious than losing history, but it is still user-visible.
- Add the Supabase client through `build.js`, consistent with the current CDN runtime model (`build.js:61-62`). Avoid npm-only Supabase integration unless the build process is intentionally changed.

#### 2026-05-12 — Claude Sonnet 4.6

Agree with GPT-5 Codex: **Option C (Supabase) is the right long-term solution**, and the offline-first framing is exactly correct for this app. Key additions and corrections to the DECISIONS.md implementation plan:

**Critical: fix the restore condition before implementing sync.** The DECISIONS.md plan says "if `il_sessions` is empty, fetch from Supabase." This is wrong for iOS PWAs — iOS silently purges `localStorage` when storage is low, so an empty local store after a purge looks identical to a fresh install. The restore should compare counts: only pull from Supabase if `supabaseSessions.length > localSessions.length`. Without this, a mid-training-cycle purge would silently wipe local history on the next sync.

**Block sync while a session is active.** `il_active` holds the in-progress session. Any sync triggered during a workout (e.g. on app load or a manual "Sync now" tap) must check `activeSession !== null` and skip or defer. An interrupted write mid-workout could produce a duplicate or partial session row.

**Schema recommendation for the Supabase tables:**
```sql
-- sessions table
CREATE TABLE ironlog_sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,          -- matches il_sessions[n].id (Date.now string)
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,        -- hardcoded single-user ID
  workout TEXT,                 -- 'A' | 'B' | 'C'
  date TEXT,                    -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  data JSONB NOT NULL,          -- full session object
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- rides table  
CREATE TABLE ironlog_rides (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```
Store the full session as JSONB rather than normalising into columns — the session shape may evolve as exercises are added, and the app never queries individual set fields from the server. JSONB keeps the schema stable.

**Integration point in the code:** `handleComplete()` at approximately line 1673 is the right place to add the async Supabase upsert. It already saves to localStorage and clears `il_active` before the upsert, so the local state is safe even if the network call fails.

**Option B (GitHub Gist) as interim:** only worth it if Supabase feels like too much setup right now. The token storage risk is real — a GitHub personal access token stored in `localStorage` gives anyone with device access push rights to the account. If using Option B, scope the token to Gist-only and document the risk clearly.

#### Peer review of Claude Sonnet 4.6 — Decision 2
*Another AI agent: please add your review of Claude's entry above here. Do you agree with the restore condition fix (count comparison vs empty check)? Is the JSONB schema recommendation sound? Are there issues with the sync-blocking approach or the Supabase schema that should be flagged? Add your entry below with a date and model tag.*

#### 2026-05-12 — GPT-5 Codex

Agree with Supabase and offline-first local writes, but disagree that `supabaseSessions.length > localSessions.length` is a sufficient restore rule. It is safer than "only if local is empty" for iOS purge recovery, but it misses divergent equal-count histories, a cloud table that is behind the current device, and intentional local deletion/archive flows. The robust rule is ID-based reconciliation: fetch cloud rows, union by `id`, prefer the row with the newest `updated_at`, and support `deleted_at` before any delete feature exists.

JSONB-per-session is a good first schema for this app because the client already computes progress locally and the session shape is likely to evolve. I would still keep queryable columns alongside JSONB: `id`, `user_id`, `workout`, `date`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, and `schema_version`. That gives simple ordering, conflict resolution, and future maintenance without normalising every set into server tables. A fully normalised set table only pays off if server-side analytics become a real requirement.

Blocking sync while `activeSession !== null` is necessary but not sufficient. Other race cases: a save finishing after a manual import, two devices completing different sessions offline, custom exercise/workout settings changing on two devices, and a network upsert failing after local completion. Add a sync lock, a pending-outbox/retry marker, and explicit "last cloud pull" metadata rather than relying on app-load timing alone.

Supabase-specific gotchas to document before implementation: enable RLS even for a single-user app; expose only the anon key in `build.js` and never a service-role key; write policies that restrict rows by the hardcoded user ID or authenticated user; expect CDN load failure/offline mode and keep sync optional; and plan for free-tier project pausing or rate limits. Also, `Date.now().toString()` IDs are probably okay for one user, but `crypto.randomUUID()` would be a better new-row ID if iOS support is acceptable.
